# Usage of process.py

The script will use the csv file under `/data` and it will unpivote the 
original `xls` file and sort data by Country (alphabetically) and by Year 
(ascending order).

Afterwards, it will delete rows with blank inputs.

## Requirements

Run the requirements through `pip` in order to install all required packages to 
run the script.

`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

## Contributing

This dataset will eventually need an update, specially because there are many

but please follow [OKFN's curator guide](http://data.okfn.org/doc/core-data-curators)
to keep things as organized as possible.
